# CS361-MicroserviceA

1. Clear instructions for how to programmatically REQUEST data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call.

The microservice requests data through the instruction of asking for the "pipe". When main is run, in the terminal the program asks for the txt file that it will read from. You must enter the txt file you have or the one provided in my example. My example is titled "artists.txt"

2. Clear instructions for how to programmatically RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented.

The microservice will continuously ask the user for a valid txt file until it receives one. One it does it will communicate so by stating 'Data has been successfully retrieved.' As will as state it have written the organized data into the new txt file titled "documentation.txt" 
   
3. UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data works. Make it detailed enough that your teammate (and your grader) will understand.

Below is the understanding of the program through the diagram.
